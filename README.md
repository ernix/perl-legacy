# WHAT IS THIS?

Good old perl scripts mainly used for Japanese CGI programs over a decade ago.

# WHY?

There still are tons of code lying around using these scripts in spite of
obsoleting some syntax by perl itself.  Thus, I'm trying to update for current
stable perl.

# ARE YOU KIDDING?

Yes I am! You really shouldn't be using them.
I'm sure there are better replacement modules/scripts, but who cares?
