# perl-legacy

Good old perl libraries mainly used for Japanese CGI programs over a decade ago.

![Build status](https://github.com/ernix/perl-legacy/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

There still are tons of unmaintainable programs that rely on old libraries.
Some of these are too old and can not catch up with newer versions of Perl.

This repository contains minimum patches for these libraries so that they can
be used for the latest stable perl version.
