# perl-legacy

Good old Perl libraries mainly used in Japanese CGI applications since several decades ago.

![Build status](https://github.com/ernix/perl-legacy/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

There still are tons of abandoned but live applications depends on these libraries.
Some of them are hopelessly unmaintainable and cannot even catch up with newer versions of Perl.

This repository contains minimum patches of those libraries so that they can
be used with the latest stable Perl version.
